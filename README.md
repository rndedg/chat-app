## chat-app



### Description
I built this project following [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-realtime-chat-app-with-react-express-socketio-and-harperdb/) tutorial to get more practice with JS and also to learn more about Sockets. I had a good time following the walkthrough as it was very concise and easy to read. Lots of information with very little 'fluff' material.
